For example; menstrual disorders are corrected and. normalized through yoga, Proper practice of yoga during early stages of pregnancy enhances the health of the child in womb and it also helps to make the delivery painless.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow much yoga: Yoga, can be practiced for a longer time in the winter season than in summer. Maximum time devoted for actually practicing yoga should not exceed forty-five minute in a single day of winter. In summer, the maximum time for actual practice should be thirty minutes, Time for rest may be allowed in addition according to the principle mentioned above. This difference in practicing time has to be maintained because of variation in impact of weather on the body.\\n\\n\\n\\nThough there should be only one session of yoga practice in a day, those who would like to divide their time into two sessions should allow a gap of eight hours between the first and the second session. A minimum practice of fifteen minutes per day should be quite satisfactory for maintaining good health.\\n\\nWith the above-mentioned clarifications about therapeutic yoga and its basic requirements, let us now explain what is meant by \'proper diet\' in the yoga system. A proper understanding of some of the established principles and advice about diet would help the practitioners realize the importance of food and its impact on the body system in a better way. Though specific diet-charts are already mentioned for different types of diseases, the users of this book are advised to read the following section on \'proper diet\' for a comprehensive knowledge of it.\\n\\nProper Diet\\n\\nDiet occupies a dominant place in the yoga \'system. it is said that \'as you eat, so you become\'. This is because the kind and quality of food affects the physical as well as mental condition of the individual. Thus, the individual who does not take a proper diet and who does not have a proper understanding of the principles of eating, gradually begins to harm himself physically and mentally both. He begins to feel the ill effects of wrong eating habits on his appearance, behavior, thought and also on action. And the individual whose thought, action and appearance would not be desirable for a particular period of time would naturally show undesirable consequences which would justify the saying that \'as you eat, so you become\'.\\n\\nIn yoga, all foods have been divided into three categories; Rajasi, Tamasi and Sattvik. These are explained below:\\n\\nRajasi: The rajasi food comprises a variety of dishes. It derives its name from the dining manners of Indian kings. It is said that no less than fifty-six dishes were served at a royal dining table. Naturally, in this type of preparations, dishes of various kinds \\u2013 some fried, some roasted, and some curried and highly seasoned \\u2013 together with various sweets and drinks would be served. Foods of this type are regarded undesirable -the yoga- practitioner as they create extra weight and fat, generate feeling of heaviness for a longer period of time after dinner and arouse passion.\\n\\n\\n\\nTamasi: The second category of eatables, that is the tamasi food include those which are prepared as hot stuffs. When any dish\\u2014vegetarian or non-vegetarian is prepared with too many spices and with excessive uses of salt, pepper, chilli and similar other seasonings, it becomes tamasi. This type of food suits those who have a coarse nature and a rough temperament, and are inclined to be noisy, quarrelsome and intolerant. Hence, this type of food is undesirable and not recommended to the yoga practitioners.\\n\\nSattvik: In this type, the food is cooked with the least amount of spices and a without much seasoning. Though the food is fresh, attractive and nutritive, it is cooked in a simple way. This type of food is desirable and thus highly recommended for the yoga practitioners.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to yogic principles, no food whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian is by itself rajasi, tamasi or sattvik. What makes it this or that type is the method of preparation and not the food by itself. The generally held notion that the non-vegetarian food is tamasi and the vegetarian food is sattvik, is wrong, because potato or cauliflower can be prepared as tamasi and meat or chicken can be cooked as sattvik, depending upon the choice of the individual.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second point which needs clarification is that in yoga, food is not evaluated on the basis of their caloric count. Rather it is quality of food and the method of eating that are considered. Better the quality of food, more invigorating it is considered. Many people have a wrong notion that by reducing their intake of food or reducing the calories, they would lose extra weight. Similarly, many people feel that perhaps by eating heavily, \\nthey could gain weight. These notions are undesirable, as both these extremes have a harmful effect on the individual. Whether a person is overweight or underweight. the yogic principles and methods of eating remain the same. One can gain or lose weight without any ill effects on his health by following the same yogic method of eating. What are then the yogic principles of eating?\\n\\nBalanced Diet\\n\\nThe most important principle is to eat a balanced diet. When the following four things are included in everyday diet, the diet becomes balanced. These items are salad, fresh vegetables, fresh fruits and raw nuts. To explain it further, whether you are a vegetarian or non-vegetarian, include these four items with your major dishes of the day.\\n\\nSalad: All the vegetables that are eaten raw, constitute salad. Things such as cucumber, tomato, carrots, lettuce, cauliflower, etc., are used for preparing salad. These should be cut into pieces and with little dressing, can be eaten raw in the quantity of about a tea-cup per day. The ideal time to eat salad is to make it as the first item of lunch and dinner.\\n\\nFresh Vegetables: Any vegetable which is not dried and is not deformed, can be regarded as fresh. They are to be preferred as fresh as possible. Fresh vegetables whether from under or above the ground, must be eaten in proportionate quantity everyday. They should, of course, be prepared in a sattvik way.\\n\\nFresh Fruits: Fruits constitute the most nutritive food for any individual. For better results from the Yogic practice, fresh fruits are essential. It is not necessary that one should take only the costly fruits, but any fruits that are easily available would serve the purpose. These fruits can be taken singly or mixed with various types. Fruits could be seasonal or year-round available types. How much to take? One apple, one orange, and one banana a day, for example, would be enough for an individual. The important point is that fruits should be eaten regularly for better health.\\n\\n\\n\\nRaw Nuts: Those nuts which are taken from hard shells are recommended. The recommended nuts are cashew, pistachio, almond, pecan and walnuts. A handful mixture of these nuts would be sufficient for a day. Since these raw nuts have warm -effect on the body, they should taken in the winter season and should be avoided or taken less in summer. Nuts from hard shells are full of proteins, minerals, and vitamins. Therefore, a proper intake of these nuts would be very energizing and healthy for the yoga practitioners, and non-practitioners alike.\\n\\n\\n\\nBesides the above-mentioned items of balanced diet, there are some other principles of diet which must be followed for a satisfactory result. They are\\n\\nQuantity of Food\\n\\nEat not more than about 85 per cent of your capacity. In other words, always keep some space left in your stomach after dinner. Do not over-eat or even to your full capacity. When food is taken less than one\'s full capacity, it is easily digested and the body makes fuller use of the intakes. On the other hand, when the food is taken excessively and the stomach is completely stuffed, it is not properly digested and the body is forced to eliminate it without making proper use of it. Further, by eating more, the individual is over-straining the abdominal system in particular and the body in general, and the performance of his physical and mental powers is obstructed. Gaining of extra and unnecessary weight is the natural outcome of overeating.\\n\\nMethod of Eating\\n\\nThe proper method is to eat slowly and swallow the food after thoroughly crushing and chewing it. One common error which the overweight people generally make is that they all eat too fast. It appears that the fast-eaters develop a habit and a taste wherein their satisfaction from food is only when they gulp it down. To them, chewing and then swallowing is perhaps less tasteful and boring. I recall a news item about a Texan (USA), whose dinner consisted of 18 chickens. He weighed more than 500. lbs., but he could-not do much physical work. It can well be imagined that if he paid due attention to chewing all the chickens properly, he would be spending at least six to eight hours a day just for dinner, let alone his breakfast, lunch and other refreshments. The repercussions of that type of eating have already been explained.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe yogic system, thus, takes into consideration the ill effects of fast eating and emphasizes the importance of slow eating. But the question is,  how slow? It depends on the type of food one is eating. For example, banana can be chewed faster than apple. Meat eating would take more time than fish. But in all circumstances, the guideline is to chew the food till it is rolled up and only then it should be swallowed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many benefits of slow eating. The individual gets full satisfaction in dinner even when he eats only a small quantity of food. Saliva can be properly mixed up with the food and make it easily digestible. The body makes the full use of any food taken and the individual maintains a better health by less amount of food.\\n\\nTime Factor: Eat at least two hours before retiring time. A common error with most of the people is that they eat and then soon go to sleep, especially so during the night time. This has a very harmful effect upon their health. By eating hours ahead of sleeping time, the food is properly processed by the body. The stomach is not heavy and when the individuals goes to sleep, they get undisturbed sleep and rest. Most of the people, who complain of abdominal, stomach or bowel troubles, are in the habit of eating and then immediately going to sleep. By so doing, they put undue strain on the abdominal muscles. They get disturbed sleep and most of the time they suffer from digestion ailments and disorders. Attention and care for early eating would correct these troubles.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother important aspect which needs clarification is: bow many times one should eat? It is recommended that one should eat four times within a period of twenty-four hours. This means having breakfast in the morning, lunch at noon, some refreshment in the afternoon and dinner in the evening. It is up to the individual to eat according to his choice and preference, while keeping in mind the yogic principles. Unless one is faced with some special occasions, eating four times should be made a habit of daily life.\\n\\nSpices: It is recommended not to use too much spices while preparing various dishes. This means not to use too much salt, chilli, pepper and other herbs. It is not to say that spices are bad. The objection is to excessive use of spices and seasoning. The seasoning can be done for flavor, but excessive use should be avoided. The food should be so seasoned that it does not become Tamasi, but remain sauvik in nature.\\n\\nWater: It is recommended that the yoga practitioners should drink about five lbs. (about ten to twelve glasses) of water every day. Water should not be taken at the time of eating, but after half an hour of eating. Accord\\n\\nAP\\n\\nAPing to yogic literature, several skin diseases and disorders are corrected if water is not taken while eating. The drinking of plenty of water is highly recommended in yogic literature, because it is held that water cleans and washes out the impurities of the system. Many people do not drink enough water. I have personally known some people who were in the habit of drinking very little or not drinking water at all. Instead of water, they used to take juice, milk and some other liquids. As a result, they had developed a number of ailments and physical disorders. But most of these ailments were corrected when they started taking plenty of water every day. Therefore, the yoga practitioners should take five lbs. or more of fresh water within a period of twenty-four hours.\\n\\nCoffee and Tea: Both coffee and tea are injurious to health when taken in excess. Modern people are now so much used to tea and coffee in their daily lives that it is not easy to abandon them. But a restraint on their intake must be maintained for better health. It is recommended that not more than two cups of tea or coffee should be taken in a period of twenty-four hours. There  are various reasons for this restraint. Both these drinks if taken in large quantities, cause constipation, insomnia, nervous tension and other internal disorders. It has also been felt that an excess intake of these beverages, distorts the natural complexion of the skin and also there is some roughening effect on the facial tissues. Therefore, a limit must be maintained in taking tea and coffee.\\n\\nAlcoholic Drinks: All alcoholic drinks are regarded as vitamin thieves. They steel and destroy the nutrients of the system. Our objection to taking alcoholic drinks is not because they are intoxicative, but mainly because they weaken the individual, physically and mentally, if taken without restraint. The destructive powers of alcoholic drinks are more in hard liquors and less in the weaker ones. But regardless of high or low alcoholic percentage in a drink, if a daily habit of drinking is maintained, it would prove extremely harmful. Therefore, the yoga practitioners are advised to avoid making it a habit of taking these drinks every day.\\n\\nGram (chickpeas): Sprouted gram (chickpeas) is a very nutritious grain. It is full of protein, minerals and vitamins. Regular intake of a handful of germinated gram is highly conducive to good health. Yoga practitioners are, therefore, advised to make it a part of their daily eating. Green grams can be eaten fresh. The ripe ones should be eaten after soaking it in water for about eight hours. The sprouted grams are better than the plain ones, as the sprouted ones get enriched with energy derived from the air and light. It might be mentioned that if a person is not able to eat raw nuts and fruits regularly, he can compensate-this loss by eating sprouted grams regularly.\\n\\nThe recommendations on diet can be summed up by saying that yogic principles of diet are so simple that the yoga practitioners (whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian) should have no difficulty in following them.

For example; menstrual disorders are corrected and. normalized through yoga, Proper practice of yoga during early stages of pregnancy enhances the health of the child in womb and it also helps to make the delivery painless.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow much yoga: Yoga, can be practiced for a longer time in the winter season than in summer. Maximum time devoted for actually practicing yoga should not exceed forty-five minute in a single day of winter. In summer, the maximum time for actual practice should be thirty minutes, Time for rest may be allowed in addition according to the principle mentioned above. This difference in practicing time has to be maintained because of variation in impact of weather on the body.\\n\\n\\n\\nThough there should be only one session of yoga practice in a day, those who would like to divide their time into two sessions should allow a gap of eight hours between the first and the second session. A minimum practice of fifteen minutes per day should be quite satisfactory for maintaining good health.\\n\\nWith the above-mentioned clarifications about therapeutic yoga and its basic requirements, let us now explain what is meant by \'proper diet\' in the yoga system. A proper understanding of some of the established principles and advice about diet would help the practitioners realize the importance of food and its impact on the body system in a better way. Though specific diet-charts are already mentioned for different types of diseases, the users of this book are advised to read the following section on \'proper diet\' for a comprehensive knowledge of it.\\n\\nProper Diet\\n\\nDiet occupies a dominant place in the yoga \'system. it is said that \'as you eat, so you become\'. This is because the kind and quality of food affects the physical as well as mental condition of the individual. Thus, the individual who does not take a proper diet and who does not have a proper understanding of the principles of eating, gradually begins to harm himself physically and mentally both. He begins to feel the ill effects of wrong eating habits on his appearance, behavior, thought and also on action. And the individual whose thought, action and appearance would not be desirable for a particular period of time would naturally show undesirable consequences which would justify the saying that \'as you eat, so you become\'.\\n\\nIn yoga, all foods have been divided into three categories; Rajasi, Tamasi and Sattvik. These are explained below:\\n\\nRajasi: The rajasi food comprises a variety of dishes. It derives its name from the dining manners of Indian kings. It is said that no less than fifty-six dishes were served at a royal dining table. Naturally, in this type of preparations, dishes of various kinds \\u2013 some fried, some roasted, and some curried and highly seasoned \\u2013 together with various sweets and drinks would be served. Foods of this type are regarded undesirable -the yoga- practitioner as they create extra weight and fat, generate feeling of heaviness for a longer period of time after dinner and arouse passion.\\n\\n\\n\\nTamasi: The second category of eatables, that is the tamasi food include those which are prepared as hot stuffs. When any dish\\u2014vegetarian or non-vegetarian is prepared with too many spices and with excessive uses of salt, pepper, chilli and similar other seasonings, it becomes tamasi. This type of food suits those who have a coarse nature and a rough temperament, and are inclined to be noisy, quarrelsome and intolerant. Hence, this type of food is undesirable and not recommended to the yoga practitioners.\\n\\nSattvik: In this type, the food is cooked with the least amount of spices and a without much seasoning. Though the food is fresh, attractive and nutritive, it is cooked in a simple way. This type of food is desirable and thus highly recommended for the yoga practitioners.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to yogic principles, no food whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian is by itself rajasi, tamasi or sattvik. What makes it this or that type is the method of preparation and not the food by itself. The generally held notion that the non-vegetarian food is tamasi and the vegetarian food is sattvik, is wrong, because potato or cauliflower can be prepared as tamasi and meat or chicken can be cooked as sattvik, depending upon the choice of the individual.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second point which needs clarification is that in yoga, food is not evaluated on the basis of their caloric count. Rather it is quality of food and the method of eating that are considered. Better the quality of food, more invigorating it is considered. Many people have a wrong notion that by reducing their intake of food or reducing the calories, they would lose extra weight. Similarly, many people feel that perhaps by eating heavily, \\nthey could gain weight. These notions are undesirable, as both these extremes have a harmful effect on the individual. Whether a person is overweight or underweight. the yogic principles and methods of eating remain the same. One can gain or lose weight without any ill effects on his health by following the same yogic method of eating. What are then the yogic principles of eating?\\n\\nBalanced Diet\\n\\nThe most important principle is to eat a balanced diet. When the following four things are included in everyday diet, the diet becomes balanced. These items are salad, fresh vegetables, fresh fruits and raw nuts. To explain it further, whether you are a vegetarian or non-vegetarian, include these four items with your major dishes of the day.\\n\\nSalad: All the vegetables that are eaten raw, constitute salad. Things such as cucumber, tomato, carrots, lettuce, cauliflower, etc., are used for preparing salad. These should be cut into pieces and with little dressing, can be eaten raw in the quantity of about a tea-cup per day. The ideal time to eat salad is to make it as the first item of lunch and dinner.\\n\\nFresh Vegetables: Any vegetable which is not dried and is not deformed, can be regarded as fresh. They are to be preferred as fresh as possible. Fresh vegetables whether from under or above the ground, must be eaten in proportionate quantity everyday. They should, of course, be prepared in a sattvik way.\\n\\nFresh Fruits: Fruits constitute the most nutritive food for any individual. For better results from the Yogic practice, fresh fruits are essential. It is not necessary that one should take only the costly fruits, but any fruits that are easily available would serve the purpose. These fruits can be taken singly or mixed with various types. Fruits could be seasonal or year-round available types. How much to take? One apple, one orange, and one banana a day, for example, would be enough for an individual. The important point is that fruits should be eaten regularly for better health.\\n\\n\\n\\nRaw Nuts: Those nuts which are taken from hard shells are recommended. The recommended nuts are cashew, pistachio, almond, pecan and walnuts. A handful mixture of these nuts would be sufficient for a day. Since these raw nuts have warm -effect on the body, they should taken in the winter season and should be avoided or taken less in summer. Nuts from hard shells are full of proteins, minerals, and vitamins. Therefore, a proper intake of these nuts would be very energizing and healthy for the yoga practitioners, and non-practitioners alike.\\n\\n\\n\\nBesides the above-mentioned items of balanced diet, there are some other principles of diet which must be followed for a satisfactory result. They are\\n\\nQuantity of Food\\n\\nEat not more than about 85 per cent of your capacity. In other words, always keep some space left in your stomach after dinner. Do not over-eat or even to your full capacity. When food is taken less than one\'s full capacity, it is easily digested and the body makes fuller use of the intakes. On the other hand, when the food is taken excessively and the stomach is completely stuffed, it is not properly digested and the body is forced to eliminate it without making proper use of it. Further, by eating more, the individual is over-straining the abdominal system in particular and the body in general, and the performance of his physical and mental powers is obstructed. Gaining of extra and unnecessary weight is the natural outcome of overeating.\\n\\nMethod of Eating\\n\\nThe proper method is to eat slowly and swallow the food after thoroughly crushing and chewing it. One common error which the overweight people generally make is that they all eat too fast. It appears that the fast-eaters develop a habit and a taste wherein their satisfaction from food is only when they gulp it down. To them, chewing and then swallowing is perhaps less tasteful and boring. I recall a news item about a Texan (USA), whose dinner consisted of 18 chickens. He weighed more than 500. lbs., but he could-not do much physical work. It can well be imagined that if he paid due attention to chewing all the chickens properly, he would be spending at least six to eight hours a day just for dinner, let alone his breakfast, lunch and other refreshments. The repercussions of that type of eating have already been explained.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe yogic system, thus, takes into consideration the ill effects of fast eating and emphasizes the importance of slow eating. But the question is,  how slow? It depends on the type of food one is eating. For example, banana can be chewed faster than apple. Meat eating would take more time than fish. But in all circumstances, the guideline is to chew the food till it is rolled up and only then it should be swallowed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many benefits of slow eating. The individual gets full satisfaction in dinner even when he eats only a small quantity of food. Saliva can be properly mixed up with the food and make it easily digestible. The body makes the full use of any food taken and the individual maintains a better health by less amount of food.\\n\\nTime Factor: Eat at least two hours before retiring time. A common error with most of the people is that they eat and then soon go to sleep, especially so during the night time. This has a very harmful effect upon their health. By eating hours ahead of sleeping time, the food is properly processed by the body. The stomach is not heavy and when the individuals goes to sleep, they get undisturbed sleep and rest. Most of the people, who complain of abdominal, stomach or bowel troubles, are in the habit of eating and then immediately going to sleep. By so doing, they put undue strain on the abdominal muscles. They get disturbed sleep and most of the time they suffer from digestion ailments and disorders. Attention and care for early eating would correct these troubles.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother important aspect which needs clarification is: bow many times one should eat? It is recommended that one should eat four times within a period of twenty-four hours. This means having breakfast in the morning, lunch at noon, some refreshment in the afternoon and dinner in the evening. It is up to the individual to eat according to his choice and preference, while keeping in mind the yogic principles. Unless one is faced with some special occasions, eating four times should be made a habit of daily life.\\n\\nSpices: It is recommended not to use too much spices while preparing various dishes. This means not to use too much salt, chilli, pepper and other herbs. It is not to say that spices are bad. The objection is to excessive use of spices and seasoning. The seasoning can be done for flavor, but excessive use should be avoided. The food should be so seasoned that it does not become Tamasi, but remain sauvik in nature.\\n\\nWater: It is recommended that the yoga practitioners should drink about five lbs. (about ten to twelve glasses) of water every day. Water should not be taken at the time of eating, but after half an hour of eating. Accord\\n\\nAP\\n\\nAPing to yogic literature, several skin diseases and disorders are corrected if water is not taken while eating. The drinking of plenty of water is highly recommended in yogic literature, because it is held that water cleans and washes out the impurities of the system. Many people do not drink enough water. I have personally known some people who were in the habit of drinking very little or not drinking water at all. Instead of water, they used to take juice, milk and some other liquids. As a result, they had developed a number of ailments and physical disorders. But most of these ailments were corrected when they started taking plenty of water every day. Therefore, the yoga practitioners should take five lbs. or more of fresh water within a period of twenty-four hours.\\n\\nCoffee and Tea: Both coffee and tea are injurious to health when taken in excess. Modern people are now so much used to tea and coffee in their daily lives that it is not easy to abandon them. But a restraint on their intake must be maintained for better health. It is recommended that not more than two cups of tea or coffee should be taken in a period of twenty-four hours. There  are various reasons for this restraint. Both these drinks if taken in large quantities, cause constipation, insomnia, nervous tension and other internal disorders. It has also been felt that an excess intake of these beverages, distorts the natural complexion of the skin and also there is some roughening effect on the facial tissues. Therefore, a limit must be maintained in taking tea and coffee.\\n\\nAlcoholic Drinks: All alcoholic drinks are regarded as vitamin thieves. They steel and destroy the nutrients of the system. Our objection to taking alcoholic drinks is not because they are intoxicative, but mainly because they weaken the individual, physically and mentally, if taken without restraint. The destructive powers of alcoholic drinks are more in hard liquors and less in the weaker ones. But regardless of high or low alcoholic percentage in a drink, if a daily habit of drinking is maintained, it would prove extremely harmful. Therefore, the yoga practitioners are advised to avoid making it a habit of taking these drinks every day.\\n\\nGram (chickpeas): Sprouted gram (chickpeas) is a very nutritious grain. It is full of protein, minerals and vitamins. Regular intake of a handful of germinated gram is highly conducive to good health. Yoga practitioners are, therefore, advised to make it a part of their daily eating. Green grams can be eaten fresh. The ripe ones should be eaten after soaking it in water for about eight hours. The sprouted grams are better than the plain ones, as the sprouted ones get enriched with energy derived from the air and light. It might be mentioned that if a person is not able to eat raw nuts and fruits regularly, he can compensate-this loss by eating sprouted grams regularly.\\n\\nThe recommendations on diet can be summed up by saying that yogic principles of diet are so simple that the yoga practitioners (whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian) should have no difficulty in following them. If these principles are followed closely and if the individual makes\\n---------------------\\n

Though the food is fresh, attractive and nutritive, it is cooked in a simple way. This type of food is desirable and thus highly recommended for the yoga practitioners.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to yogic principles, no food whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian is by itself rajasi, tamasi or sattvik. What makes it this or that type is the method of preparation and not the food by itself. The generally held notion that the non-vegetarian food is tamasi and the vegetarian food is sattvik, is wrong, because potato or cauliflower can be prepared as tamasi and meat or chicken can be cooked as sattvik, depending upon the choice of the individual.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second point which needs clarification is that in yoga, food is not evaluated on the basis of their caloric count. Rather it is quality of food and the method of eating that are considered. Better the quality of food, more invigorating it is considered. Many people have a wrong notion that by reducing their intake of food or reducing the calories, they would lose extra weight. Similarly, many people feel that perhaps by eating heavily, \\nthey could gain weight. These notions are undesirable, as both these extremes have a harmful effect on the individual. Whether a person is overweight or underweight. the yogic principles and methods of eating remain the same. One can gain or lose weight without any ill effects on his health by following the same yogic method of eating. What are then the yogic principles of eating?\\n\\nBalanced Diet\\n\\nThe most important principle is to eat a balanced diet. When the following four things are included in everyday diet, the diet becomes balanced. These items are salad, fresh vegetables, fresh fruits and raw nuts. To explain it further, whether you are a vegetarian or non-vegetarian, include these four items with your major dishes of the day.\\n\\nSalad: All the vegetables that are eaten raw, constitute salad. Things such as cucumber, tomato, carrots, lettuce, cauliflower, etc., are used for preparing salad. These should be cut into pieces and with little dressing, can be eaten raw in the quantity of about a tea-cup per day. The ideal time to eat salad is to make it as the first item of lunch and dinner.\\n\\nFresh Vegetables: Any vegetable which is not dried and is not deformed, can be regarded as fresh. They are to be preferred as fresh as possible. Fresh vegetables whether from under or above the ground, must be eaten in proportionate quantity everyday. They should, of course, be prepared in a sattvik way.\\n\\nFresh Fruits: Fruits constitute the most nutritive food for any individual. For better results from the Yogic practice, fresh fruits are essential. It is not necessary that one should take only the costly fruits, but any fruits that are easily available would serve the purpose. These fruits can be taken singly or mixed with various types. Fruits could be seasonal or year-round available types. How much to take? One apple, one orange, and one banana a day, for example, would be enough for an individual. The important point is that fruits should be eaten regularly for better health.\\n\\n\\n\\nRaw Nuts: Those nuts which are taken from hard shells are recommended. The recommended nuts are cashew, pistachio, almond, pecan and walnuts. A handful mixture of these nuts would be sufficient for a day. Since these raw nuts have warm -effect on the body, they should taken in the winter season and should be avoided or taken less in summer. Nuts from hard shells are full of proteins, minerals, and vitamins. Therefore, a proper intake of these nuts would be very energizing and healthy for the yoga practitioners, and non-practitioners alike.\\n\\n\\n\\nBesides the above-mentioned items of balanced diet, there are some other principles of diet which must be followed for a satisfactory result. They are\\n\\nQuantity of Food\\n\\nEat not more than about 85 per cent of your capacity. In other words, always keep some space left in your stomach after dinner. Do not over-eat or even to your full capacity. When food is taken less than one\'s full capacity, it is easily digested and the body makes fuller use of the intakes. On the other hand, when the food is taken excessively and the stomach is completely stuffed, it is not properly digested and the body is forced to eliminate it without making proper use of it. Further, by eating more, the individual is over-straining the abdominal system in particular and the body in general, and the performance of his physical and mental powers is obstructed. Gaining of extra and unnecessary weight is the natural outcome of overeating.\\n\\nMethod of Eating\\n\\nThe proper method is to eat slowly and swallow the food after thoroughly crushing and chewing it. One common error which the overweight people generally make is that they all eat too fast. It appears that the fast-eaters develop a habit and a taste wherein their satisfaction from food is only when they gulp it down. To them, chewing and then swallowing is perhaps less tasteful and boring. I recall a news item about a Texan (USA), whose dinner consisted of 18 chickens. He weighed more than 500. lbs., but he could-not do much physical work. It can well be imagined that if he paid due attention to chewing all the chickens properly, he would be spending at least six to eight hours a day just for dinner, let alone his breakfast, lunch and other refreshments. The repercussions of that type of eating have already been explained.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe yogic system, thus, takes into consideration the ill effects of fast eating and emphasizes the importance of slow eating. But the question is,  how slow? It depends on the type of food one is eating. For example, banana can be chewed faster than apple. Meat eating would take more time than fish. But in all circumstances, the guideline is to chew the food till it is rolled up and only then it should be swallowed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many benefits of slow eating. The individual gets full satisfaction in dinner even when he eats only a small quantity of food. Saliva can be properly mixed up with the food and make it easily digestible. The body makes the full use of any food taken and the individual maintains a better health by less amount of food.\\n\\nTime Factor: Eat at least two hours before retiring time. A common error with most of the people is that they eat and then soon go to sleep, especially so during the night time. This has a very harmful effect upon their health. By eating hours ahead of sleeping time, the food is properly processed by the body. The stomach is not heavy and when the individuals goes to sleep, they get undisturbed sleep and rest. Most of the people, who complain of abdominal, stomach or bowel troubles, are in the habit of eating and then immediately going to sleep. By so doing, they put undue strain on the abdominal muscles. They get disturbed sleep and most of the time they suffer from digestion ailments and disorders. Attention and care for early eating would correct these troubles.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother important aspect which needs clarification is: bow many times one should eat? It is recommended that one should eat four times within a period of twenty-four hours. This means having breakfast in the morning, lunch at noon, some refreshment in the afternoon and dinner in the evening. It is up to the individual to eat according to his choice and preference, while keeping in mind the yogic principles. Unless one is faced with some special occasions, eating four times should be made a habit of daily life.\\n\\nSpices: It is recommended not to use too much spices while preparing various dishes. This means not to use too much salt, chilli, pepper and other herbs. It is not to say that spices are bad. The objection is to excessive use of spices and seasoning. The seasoning can be done for flavor, but excessive use should be avoided. The food should be so seasoned that it does not become Tamasi, but remain sauvik in nature.\\n\\nWater: It is recommended that the yoga practitioners should drink about five lbs. (about ten to twelve glasses) of water every day. Water should not be taken at the time of eating, but after half an hour of eating. Accord\\n\\nAP\\n\\nAPing to yogic literature, several skin diseases and disorders are corrected if water is not taken while eating. The drinking of plenty of water is highly recommended in yogic literature, because it is held that water cleans and washes out the impurities of the system. Many people do not drink enough water. I have personally known some people who were in the habit of drinking very little or not drinking water at all. Instead of water, they used to take juice, milk and some other liquids. As a result, they had developed a number of ailments and physical disorders. But most of these ailments were corrected when they started taking plenty of water every day. Therefore, the yoga practitioners should take five lbs. or more of fresh water within a period of twenty-four hours.\\n\\nCoffee and Tea: Both coffee and tea are injurious to health when taken in excess. Modern people are now so much used to tea and coffee in their daily lives that it is not easy to abandon them. But a restraint on their intake must be maintained for better health. It is recommended that not more than two cups of tea or coffee should be taken in a period of twenty-four hours. There  are various reasons for this restraint. Both these drinks if taken in large quantities, cause constipation, insomnia, nervous tension and other internal disorders. It has also been felt that an excess intake of these beverages, distorts the natural complexion of the skin and also there is some roughening effect on the facial tissues. Therefore, a limit must be maintained in taking tea and coffee.\\n\\nAlcoholic Drinks: All alcoholic drinks are regarded as vitamin thieves. They steel and destroy the nutrients of the system. Our objection to taking alcoholic drinks is not because they are intoxicative, but mainly because they weaken the individual, physically and mentally, if taken without restraint. The destructive powers of alcoholic drinks are more in hard liquors and less in the weaker ones. But regardless of high or low alcoholic percentage in a drink, if a daily habit of drinking is maintained, it would prove extremely harmful. Therefore, the yoga practitioners are advised to avoid making it a habit of taking these drinks every day.\\n\\nGram (chickpeas): Sprouted gram (chickpeas) is a very nutritious grain. It is full of protein, minerals and vitamins. Regular intake of a handful of germinated gram is highly conducive to good health. Yoga practitioners are, therefore, advised to make it a part of their daily eating. Green grams can be eaten fresh. The ripe ones should be eaten after soaking it in water for about eight hours. The sprouted grams are better than the plain ones, as the sprouted ones get enriched with energy derived from the air and light. It might be mentioned that if a person is not able to eat raw nuts and fruits regularly, he can compensate-this loss by eating sprouted grams regularly.\\n\\nThe recommendations on diet can be summed up by saying that yogic principles of diet are so simple that the yoga practitioners (whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian) should have no difficulty in following them. If these principles are followed closely and if the individual makes\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the question: Three food categories in yoga\\n"], "model": "text-davinci-003", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "n": 1, "best_of": 1, "logit_bias": {}}' message='Post details'
